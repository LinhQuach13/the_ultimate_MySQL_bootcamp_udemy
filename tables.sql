CREATE TABLE cats
  (
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
  );

--- Verify table was made
SHOW TABLES;

--- Show columns and datatypes of columns from cats table
SHOW COLUMNS FROM cats;

--- another way to show column names and datatypes of columns

--- Delete tables
DROP TABLE cats;

--- Verify table was deleted/dropped
SHOW TABLES;

--- another way to verify table was deleted/dropped, will receive an error because table no longer exists

CREATE DATABASE bakery;

--- Use bakery database
USE bakery;

--- Create pastries table
